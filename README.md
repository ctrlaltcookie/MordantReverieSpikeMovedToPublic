# Purpose

This is a simple little game project to see if i can emulate the important aspects of a visual novel in WPF and to teach me a little more WPF. This is a spike, doesn't conform to good coding practices and is definitely not fit for use outside of a quick prototype and proof of concept. It's here on request.

# Build and run

You can build this on the command line with msbuild, however it uses magic strings all over so is highly unlikely to run. It's wpf so wont run on linux or mac.
